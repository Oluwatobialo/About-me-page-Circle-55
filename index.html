            Hi there! My name is Oluwatobi Alo, and I'm thrilled to have you
            visit my "About Me" page. I was born on July 24th, which makes me a
            proud Cancer. Although I hail from Osun state, I currently reside in
            Lagos, Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a student of Applied Physics and Electronics at the
            <a href="https://unilag.edu.ng/">University of Lagos</a>, and I'm
            passionate about learning and always eager to expand my knowledge in
            various fields. In addition to my studies, I also have some work
            experience. Recently, I interned at
            <a href="https://www.buffalogrid.com/">BuffaloGrid</a>, a UK-based
            company that uses a blend of solar-powered hardware and smart
            software to bring offline streaming and content to disconnected
            communities. It was an incredible experience, and I learned a lot
            during my time there..
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also passionate about my hobbies, which include playing
            competitive basketball, swimming, drawing, and painting. These
            activities help me to relax, unwind, and keep me grounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to be a part of the
            <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/">AltSchool</a> community.
            I first heard about
            <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/">AltSchool</a> on Twitter,
            and seeing my friend go through the program and grow convinced me to
            join as well. So far, my journey at
            <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/">AltSchool</a> has been
            amazing, and I'm learning a lot from the system, which gives me the
            freedom to engage in other activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ultimate goal is to learn the basics so that I can build on that.
            I'm surrounded by great people in my
            <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/">AltSchool</a> circle, and
            I hope to get to know them well enough to consider them friends by
            the end of the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to read my "About Me" page, and I hope
            to get to know you better as well.
